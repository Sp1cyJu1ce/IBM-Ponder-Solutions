        "\n",
        "1. **Precomputation of Allowed Tuples:**\n",
        "   - Use a Sieve of Eratosthenes to compute all 5, 6-digit primes.\n",
        "   - For each prime, convert it to a tuple of digits and group these tuples by their digit sum. This sum is the magic constant \\(A\\) used in the square.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Modeling with CP-SAT and Table Constraints:**\n",
        "   - For each possible magic sum \\(A\\) (for which there is at least one valid 6-digit prime tuple), set up a CP-SAT model using OR-Tools.\n",
        "   - Create a N×N grid of digit variables (each between 0 and 9).\n",
        "   - Add table constraints so that every row, every column, and the two main diagonals (read as N-digit numbers) must match one of the precomputed tuples. This ensures that the numbers are prime and have the digit sum \\(A\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Solution Enumeration and Cost Calculation:**\n",
        "   - A custom callback processes each solution found, constructing the 2N+2 numbers (N rows, N columns, and 2 diagonals).\n",
        "   - The “cost” of a solution is computed by taking the unique primes from these \"2N+2\" numbers, counting the frequency of each digit, and summing the incremental cost (0 for the first occurrence, 1 for the second, etc.).\n",
        "   - Global tracking is used to remember the solutions with the minimal and maximal cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Efficiency Considerations:**\n",
        "   - **Table Constraints:** Restricting each line to only allowed prime tuples drastically prunes the search space.\n",
        "   - **Magic Sum Loop:** Iterating over only those \\(A\\) values that yield valid tuples avoids unnecessary models.\n",
        "   - **Time Limits:** A per-model time limit ensures that the search remains tractable.\n"
